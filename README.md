# SOLID Example

## How to use this codebase:

### Option 1: for git aficionados
1. clone this repo and browse to its directory
1. `git checkout step0` to get to the original code
1. follow along with `git checkout step{n}` for n=1..16

   Or, refactor it yourself and see how we compare!
   
### Option 2: using GitHub's UI
1. Click the `<> Code` tab
1. Click `19 commits`
1. Starting from `Original PHP file` at the bottom, click on each commit going up to see the changes
